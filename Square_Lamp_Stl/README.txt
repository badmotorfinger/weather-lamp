# Summary

I'm not including any wiring instructions as I am not an electrician. I searched how to wire two lights to one switch and kept searching till I felt confident enough. If you don't know what you are doing then don't do it. I am not responsible if you get shocked or any other bad thing that might happen. With that out of the way the wiring is super simple.

Printed without support and 0% infill. Models uploaded in correct orientation for printing.

LampTopBottomWhite - Print 2 I had the best luck printing separately 

LampMidAnyColor - Print 1 I printed in black 

CenterInsertAnyColor- Print 1 This slides into LampMidAnyColor and holds the bulbs and wiring



Parts needed
[Candelabra Base x2](http://amzn.to/2oVso70) - I cut the roller switches out and used just the clip in bulb sockets and one plug end. The rest of the wiring was done with the second cord.

[Rocker switch 16a 125v](http://amzn.to/2pkLF53) - I like using these because they mount clean... and I had one laying around

[Bulbs](http://amzn.to/2pkI6Mi) - Use E12 LED lights to cut down on heat and I wouldn't go any higher than 40 Watt equivalent.

Other things spade connectors, wire nuts, heat shrink, electrical tape, etc

Again - I'm not including any wiring instructions as I am not an electrician. I searched how to wire two lights to one switch and went from there. If you don't know what you are doing then don't do it. I am not responsible if you get shocked or any other bad thing that might happen.
